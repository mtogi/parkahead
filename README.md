### Problem: 
In Toronto's winter months, parking spaces get covered in snow, making it harder to find available spots. People also waste time driving around looking for parking.
    
  ### Solution: 
  A simple app that allows people to mark their available parking spots in driveways or street spots (especially for those with private parking). Users can reserve a parking space ahead of time for the day or week, reducing the time spent searching for parking.
    
  ### Key Features:
       - User can mark their parking spot as available or unavailable.
       - Others can see available spots near their location on a map.
       - Optional: Allow people to request and book available spots.
       - Basic functionality with a simple map and search feature.
